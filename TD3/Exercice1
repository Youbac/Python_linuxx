# Exercise 1: Grep and awk on tabular data

# 1. Display the list of files and folders at the root using ls -l
echo "List of files and folders at the root:"
ls -l /

# 2. In a pipeline (using |), append a grep instruction to only display information of bin
echo "Information of bin:"
ls -l / | grep " bin$"

# 3. Append an awk instruction to only display the size of bin
echo "Size of bin:"
ls -l / | grep " bin$" | awk '{print $5}'

# 4. Now rather extract the month, day, and year of creation of the folder bin
echo "Month, day, and year of creation of bin:"
ls -l / | grep " bin$" | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}'

# 5. Now rearrange the instruction to get the following output format: 2020-Oct-26 (from original data: Oct 26 2020)
echo "Formatted date of creation of bin:"
ls -l / | grep " bin$" | awk '{printf "%s-%s-%s\n", $8, $6, $7}'

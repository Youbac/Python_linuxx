# Exercise 4: Hashing

# 1. Create a folder named hash_checksum. Go into this folder
mkdir hash_checksum
cd hash_checksum

# 2. Inside this folder, create two files named .sensible_addresses and .sensible_passwords
touch .sensible_addresses .sensible_passwords

# 3. Display the list of files of the folder
ls -a

# 4. Still inside the folder hash_checksum, create a script named gentle_script.sh
echo 'echo "Have a good day"' > gentle_script.sh

# 5. Run the script
bash gentle_script.sh

# 6. Compute the sha256sum of gentle_script.sh. Store it into a file named log_sha
sha256sum gentle_script.sh > log_sha

# 7. Now corrupt the file by adding a line of code that deletes any file starting with: ".sensible"
echo 'rm .sensible*' >> gentle_script.sh

# 8. Compute again the sha256sum of gentle_script.sh. Store it into the log_sha file
sha256sum gentle_script.sh >> log_sha

# 9. Run the script
bash gentle_script.sh

# 10. Display again the list of files of the folder
ls -a

# 11. Display the log_sha content: are the hashes any different?
cat log_sha

# Exercise 6: ACLs - Access Control Lists

# 1. Create users
sudo adduser client_1 --gecos "" --disabled-password
echo "client_1:passwd-client_1" | sudo chpasswd

sudo adduser contributor_1 --gecos "" --disabled-password
echo "contributor_1:passwd-contributor_1" | sudo chpasswd

sudo adduser contributor_2 --gecos "" --disabled-password
echo "contributor_2:passwd-contributor_2" | sudo chpasswd

# 2. Create groups
sudo groupadd clients
sudo groupadd contributors

# 3. Add users to their respective group
sudo usermod -aG clients client_1
sudo usermod -aG contributors contributor_1
sudo usermod -aG contributors contributor_2

# 4. Check the users and groups have been successfully created
getent passwd | grep -E 'client_1|contributor_1|contributor_2'
getent group | grep -E 'clients|contributors'

# 5. Create a folder lika_project and give it the following authorizations to groups
sudo mkdir lika_project
sudo chown :clients lika_project
sudo chmod 750 lika_project
sudo setfacl -m g:contributors:rw lika_project

# 6. Also use the command ls -l and notice the change on lika_project folder
ls -ld lika_project

# 7. Change user and become as a client, then try deleting the folder
echo "As client_1, trying to delete the folder (this should fail):"
sudo -u client_1 rmdir lika_project 2>/dev/null || echo "Failed to delete the folder as client_1"

# 8. Now change user and become as a contributor, then try deleting the folder
echo "As contributor_1, trying to delete the folder (this should succeed):"
sudo -u contributor_1 rmdir lika_project && echo "Deleted the folder as contributor_1"

# 9. Check who is the current user
